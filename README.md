# CS330_Project_Ivaniv
Julia Ivaniv

This repository cosists of two files containing the code for this project (in addition to this README file).

(5 pts) Your repo must contain a README file that describes what the program does, how to build and run the executable, how to generate unit test coverage, the platform it's been tested on, plus any other information you consider useful - like the name of the author, licensing, etc.

(5 pts) A memo describing what you have done, how you have done it, and your findings. In the memo clearly state what is the language of the FA you have implemented. Also indicate what is the regular expression corresponding to that language. Attach the state transition diagram for the FA.
Direct the memo to your class instructor.

NOTE: You don't need to be concerned about optimization(s). In particular you are not required to minimize the number of states in your FAs. You can do so if you want but this is not a must.n
