I created the attached diagram for my finite automata program. I used if/else statements to go through the states in the diagram. For part 1 I used user 
input, but for part 2 I used a random number generator.

This is an example of my code:

The minimum number of symbols generated before unlocking is: 6740
The maximum number of symbols generated before unlocking is: 5545990
The average number of symbols generated before unlocking is: 907279.0
