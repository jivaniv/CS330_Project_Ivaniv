To Professor Bistriceanu

I used Python as my programming language for this assignment. 
I have .py files that can be run in the terminal as so: python Ivaniv_J_part1.py
(or Ivaniv_J_part2.py)

First I created a state transition FA diagram as demonstrated in the attached PNG file. I created a chart from the diagram to understand the inputs and 
states. I used this chart to write the code for part 1. I used if/else statements to transition between states. The first state is always s0. The states
change depending on the input as shown in the chart. My access code is 182821 and my locking code is 182824. I created a while loop so that the user can
continuously input values unless the user enters nothing, which breaks the while loop and ends the code. I hid the user input by using the python package
getpass. After each if/else block I made sure to add the code continue so that once the state changes the code moves on to the next input. The code ouputs
unlock when the access code is enter and lock when the locking code is entered. These outputs do not break the code. The user can still input values. 



The second file Ivaniv_J_part2.py is the code for part 2 of the project. This code uses a random number generator to determine how many symbols an intruder
must enter on average to unlock the lock. The same loop containing if/else statements is used as in part 1, but instead of user input, the code generates
random numbers. After each number, the code checks if the access code (182824) has been entered. This test is repeated 100 times to obtain significant 
results. The code ouputs the minimum, maximum, and average number of symbols generated before the access code is entered. 

This is an example of my code:

The minimum number of symbols generated before unlocking is: 6740
The maximum number of symbols generated before unlocking is: 5545990
The average number of symbols generated before unlocking is: 907279.0
